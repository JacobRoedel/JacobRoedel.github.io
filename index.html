<h2> Cat and Mouse Simulation<br></h2>
<p>The Cat and Mouse Simulation is a OOP based project in Java that plots creatures onto a visual grid for the user to see.
    A hashmap is used to represent the entire grid, and linked lists at each coordinate point to store a list of creatures at each point.
    There are 4 unique types of creatures in the simulation - Mouse, Cat, Zombie Cat and Terminator. The pattern of movement is unique and random for Mice and Terminators,
    but Cats and Zombie Cats have non-random movements in which Cats chase Mice, and Zombie Cats chase Cats and Mice. When chasing, the creatures change color
    to display that is in range of tracking a specific creature.
