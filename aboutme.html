        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
        <p>
            I have been involved in martial arts since the early age of 4. Throughout my involvement, I have been a member of the Chi's Martial Arts
            training facility in Deer Park, New York. I have a first degree black belt in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu concepts. As well, I have been
            an assistant instructor for youth classes since I was 13.
        </p>
        <h3>Badminton</h3>
        <p>
            I was on the varsity badminton team all four years of my high school experience. I played in the doubles division of my school's team, 
            and ended up with an undefeated season my sophomore year (16-0). As well, my partner and I won the Suffolk County Badminton Doubles Championship our junior year,
            while earning a (15-1) regular season record. That same year, my partner and I were placed on the Newsday's All-Long Island Badminton team, and were also named
            All-County players for Suffolk County. Unfortunately, COVID-19 ended our season just as it was beginning, but Badminton will always be a sport I enjoy.
