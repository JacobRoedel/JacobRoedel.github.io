        <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
        <br>
        <p class = "indented">
            I have been involved in martial arts since the early age of 4. Throughout my career, I have been a member of the Chi's Martial Arts (Martial Arts Training Center)
            training facility in Deer Park, New York. After years of studying, training, and practicing, I earned a first degree black belt in Jeet Kune Do, Jun Fan Gung Fu concepts, after passing the exam in June of 2016.
            The exam consisted of a 6 month preparation phase in which each candidate underwent extreme physical and mental training. During the preparation phase,
            I completed around 5,000 pushups, situps, and squats. In addition, I carried out acts of kindness, practiced techniques, and prepared for the 3-mile run. Starting even before I was a black belt, I have been
            an assistant instructor for youth classes. This consisted of setting up the class materials, reviewing what drills and techniques we were going to cover,
            directly practicing with students on pad work and other drills, and discussing progess with students and parents.

        <h3>Badminton</h3>
        <br>
        <p class = "indented">
            I was on the varsity badminton team all four years of my high school experience. I played in the doubles division of my high school's team, 
            and went undefeated my sophomore season (16-0). As well, my partner and I won the Suffolk County Badminton Doubles Championship our junior year,
            while earning a (15-1) regular season record. That same year, my partner and I were placed on the Newsday's All-Long Island Badminton Team and were also named
            All-County players for Suffolk County. Unfortunately, COVID-19 ended our season just as it was beginning, but Badminton will always be a sport I enjoy.
